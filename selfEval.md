# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
1. As usual I struggled a bit with the syntax and formatting of everything.
2. I find myself taking the most helpful notes during live classes, I rarely take notes outside of live class because I'm usually trying out whatever I'm learning as I go.
3. I try really hard to get it on my own first but when I need it google is a massive help.
